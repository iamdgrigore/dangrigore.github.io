# Eyes Moving Exercise

![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emeritus101/emeritus101.github.io/blob/main/portfolio/eyes/eyes.JPG)

## Description: 
This is an exercise on which I worked in Week 8 of the MIT xPro MERN JavaScript course. 
We are using Styles and Bootstrap in order to create a dynamic movement of the eyes, following the marker on the screen.

## How to run:
1. Move the mouse over the screen
2. The eyes will folow the movement of the mouse icon on the display (version 1.0)

## Roadmap of future improvements:
1. Add a drop-down to choose between different effects on the eyes (smile, serious)
2. Add a Solar System type stylesheet (for example Martian eyes)
