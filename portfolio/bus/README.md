![name-of-you-image](https://github.com/emeritus101/emeritus101.github.io/blob/main/portfolio/bus/bus.JPG)

## Description: 
Using the free Mapbox account, we are using HTML, CSS and Javascript to map the route of the bus between MIT and Harvard. 
We are looping or moving the marker through the array consisting of the several stops of the bus on the route.

## How to run:
1. Click the 'Track Bus button
2. The stations will be displayed for the route between MIT and Harvard (version 1.0)

## Roadmap of future improvements:
1. Adding a search area to search for a specific route
2. Adding a display area to present distance from bus from origin and to destination, with schedule
3. Add a bus icon to better identify its movement in the page
